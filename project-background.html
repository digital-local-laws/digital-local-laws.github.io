      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>New York State contains over 1,600 general purpose local governments counties, towns, villages, and cities.
      Each local government has authority to adopt its own laws on a wide array of subjects.
      In 2014, more than 4,200 local laws were adopted.
      Local governments have long been required to submit their laws to the Department of State (DOS), and they currently must do so by a paper-based process.
      Each time a law is adopted, an official specified by statute must complete a certification form, prepare the law in print format that follows certain formal requirements, and mail that form to the Division of Corporations, State Records, and UCC at DOS (State Records).
      State Records must then manually verify the submitted document meets formal requirements, scan the document, and file it.
      State Records stores the scanned copy in an enterprise content management system that performs optical character recognition and some indexing of the document&#8217;s contents.
      <a href="#high_level_law">High Level Model of Local Legislative Process in New York State</a> illustrates this process at a high level.
      State Records has authority to provide for electronic transmission as an alternative to the paper-based process, but has not implemented such a solution.</p>

      <p>This project seeks to prototype such a solution using technology developed to manage computer source code and publish books online.
      The idea is inspired both others' observations that <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2010/06/kliss-law-as-source-code.html">law is like source code</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government?language=en">should be developed more like source code</a> using distributed revision control tools.

      <p>Compared with legislators, coders can:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ulist">
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Know every change, who made it, and why.
      Revision control enables line by line reporting of the history of every file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Track changes across multiple, interrelated files.
      Revision control takes a snapshot of a collection of files and stores it in a repository that is separate from the files themselves.  So any content&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;text, pictures, video&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can be tracked over time as it changes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Share and accept contributions without sacrificing control.
      Revision control enables the coder to share the code in a way where others can make their own copy, improve it, and submit their improvements back to the author.
      The author always retains control over when or if those changes are accepted in his or her own copy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Access any past version that was ever shared.
      The repository, which contains the history of changes to the collection of documents, is checked out by each contributor.
      So everyone is able to compare and share with any previously shared version.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Run &#8220;builds&#8221; to make internally consistent &#8220;products&#8221; from any version.
      Coders largely automated the tasks that move from the source code they right to the software they deploy.
      Continuous integration platforms enable each iteration of sharing to automatically trigger testing and releasing new versions of software.
      This enables coders to respond quickly to problems or requests for improvements.
      The same tools are also used to convert textual sources of books into printable PDF, ereader EPUB, and web HTML editions.</p>
